With the Sinatra project behind me, I don’t really have much to say. It was fun
challenge to quickly whip up a Sinatra project and make an app from scratch.
lucky Sinatra’s API is incredibly simple to understand and by just browsing the
documentation on the [Sinatra website](http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html) you can find many useful methods that you
might not have known was available! Other then finding a few extra useful
methods on the Sinatra site, I found that this project was more on the lines of
solidifying some of the ruby fundamentals and recapping Sinatra along with
reaffirming how CRUD is applied.
