To put it simply programming is one of the things I enjoy most, the freedom, unlimited creative potential, and usefulness that arises from software development or any type of programming. Its captivating. There really isn’t anything else quite like it. Solving logical problems, taking any idea you have and making it a reality, shipping a product that people can use, make tedious tasks easer or add a little entertainment to someone’s day. It’s an amazing industry and something that I would love to be a part of.
