The rails project has been the most content heavy project yet. Having a huge
generated file structure that’s populated with many pre-configured files and
configuration settings, it’s a little overwhelming. However, after exploring
through the files lots of experimenting you start to learn how it all comes
together. After several hours of tinkering with the new rails 5.2 release the
Tasks app was born!

Loosely based off my earlier To-Do’s Sinatra app, Tasks is an expanded version with a kenban inspired design Featuring tasks that are categorized by tags, and then separated into groupings
called projects. The projects support multiple users interacting with the tasks
within and even allowing users to assign a task to another, displaying the most
recent updates on the user’s dashboard. The tasks app is quite the step up in
complexity from the Sinatra To-Do’s, however it’s a welcome one.
